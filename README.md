### About me 
I'm Sejal, somebody who's trying to get through this crazy world while discovering new things everyday. I'm a software engineer by profession, but my interests and goals are much larger than just code. **I am passionate about creating a positive impact in the world**, and code is just one avenue that I use to achieve that. 

### Quick Facts ‚è©

* üòÑ Pronouns: She/Her
* ‚ö° Fun Fact: I function on caffeine :coffee:

#### Code Graveyard Disclaimer ‚ò†Ô∏è

Just a quick disclaimer! My github profile is mostly graveyard projects from college. Feel free to look around - but remember that **much of this code was written was I was just a student**. Most of my newer code is proprietary (for the moment) so I can't really share it, I'm working towards updating this profile and contribute to opensource.

### üì´ Say Hi:   

Honestly, the best way to reach out to me is probably via a Direct Message on any of my social accounts. We can talk about technoloy, food, music, unicorns or really anything nice and geeky! I enjoy sharing my experiences, but I enjoy hearing others' personal journeys and opinions more.
